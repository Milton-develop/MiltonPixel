    <h1>ABOUT MiltonPixel</h1>
    <h2>
        Hi, I’m Moses Milton the creative force behind MiltonPixel. I’m a web and graphic designer who lives for that sweet spot where clean code meets compelling visuals. Whether I’m crafting a responsive website, designing a brand’s visual identity, or polishing an interface until the pixels sing, my goal is always the same: make digital experiences that feel as good as they look.

My journey began with a fascination for how ideas take shape on screen. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a passion for turning concepts into carefully engineered realities using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a toolbox such as Canva, Affinity and Figma to bring stories to life. I believe great design should do more than catch the eye: it should inspire, and solve real problems.

From elegant landing pages to vibrant social graphics, every project is a chance for me to elevate a brand’s voice and leave a lasting impression. If you’re ready to transform your vision into something memorable, let’s make it happen pixel by pixel.
